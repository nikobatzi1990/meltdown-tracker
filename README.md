# Meltdown Tracker

## [Deployed Application](https://solo-mvp-meltdown-trackers.onrender.com)

## Project Description

##### The Meltdown Tracker is a tool for parents of children with autism and is designed to help them keep track of the frequency of their childâ€™s meltdowns along with any environmental factors that were present at the time. It can be difficult to pinpoint what exactly might cause a child with autism to suffer a meltdown since every child is different and will react differently to environmental stimuli. This is especially true when the child is non-verbal and can't easily communicate what is upsetting them. It will likely take a long time and many meltdowns before the parent is finally able to identify the trigger accurately. This application aims to make that process quicker by giving parents an easy way to keep track of incidents and notice patterns.
